      subheading: "Server-Side Development with Node.js",
      description:
        "This section introduces Node.js, a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. You will learn how to set up a Node.js environment and create simple server applications using built-in modules. We will cover concepts such as middleware functions and routing using Express.js—a popular web application framework for Node.js. You’ll understand how to handle HTTP requests and responses effectively while building RESTful APIs that can serve data to your frontend applications. By the end of this section, you’ll have a solid understanding of server-side development using Node.js.",
    },
    {
      subheading: "Database Management with MongoDB",
      description:
        "In this section, you'll be introduced to MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. You will learn how to set up a MongoDB database locally as well as in the cloud using services like MongoDB Atlas. We will cover CRUD operations using Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that simplifies data manipulation within your Node.js applications. Additionally, we’ll discuss data validation techniques and indexing for performance optimization. By the end of this section, you’ll be proficient in managing data within MongoDB databases.",
