      subheading: "Introduction to Java",
      description:
        "In this section, you will be introduced to Java, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. We will cover the basics of Java syntax, data types, variables, and operators. You will learn how to set up your development environment using tools like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and how to compile and run your first Java program. Additionally, we will discuss the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its role in executing Java applications. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Java programming.",

      subheading: "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts",
      description:
        "This section delves into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is central to Java development. You will learn about key concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. We will explore how to design and implement classes in Java and how to use constructors and methods effectively. By understanding OOP principles, you will be able to create modular and reusable code that simplifies complex problems. By the end of this section, you’ll be equipped to apply OOP concepts in your Java applications.",

      subheading: "Control Flow and Exception Handling",
      description:
        "In this section, you will learn about control flow statements in Java that allow you to dictate the execution path of your programs. We will cover conditional statements like if-else and switch-case as well as looping constructs such as for, while, and do-while loops. Additionally, we will explore exception handling using try-catch blocks to manage errors gracefully in your applications. Understanding control flow and exception handling is crucial for writing robust applications that can handle unexpected situations effectively. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid grasp of these essential programming constructs.",
    },
    {
      subheading: "Data Structures and Collections Framework",
      description:
        "This section introduces you to data structures in Java and the Collections Framework that provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of objects. You will learn about commonly used data structures such as arrays, lists (ArrayList and LinkedList), sets (HashSet), and maps (HashMap). We will discuss when to use each data structure based on performance considerations and specific use cases. Additionally, you'll explore iterators for traversing collections efficiently. By the end of this section, you'll be proficient in selecting appropriate data structures for various programming scenarios.",
    },
    {
      subheading: "Working with Files and Streams",
      description:
        "In this section, you will learn how to handle file input/output operations in Java using streams. We will cover reading from and writing to text files using FileReader and FileWriter classes as well as working with binary files using InputStream and OutputStream classes. You'll also explore advanced topics such as serialization for saving object states to files. Understanding file handling is essential for developing applications that require persistent data storage. By the end of this section, you'll be able to implement file operations effectively within your Java applications.",
    },
    {
      subheading: "Introduction to Frameworks - Spring",
      description:
        "This section introduces Spring Framework, one of the most popular frameworks for building enterprise-level applications in Java. You will learn about Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) principles that form the backbone of Spring's architecture. We will explore how to create Spring Boot applications that simplify configuration and deployment processes. Additionally, you’ll understand how Spring facilitates RESTful web services development through its MVC architecture. By the end of this section, you'll have a foundational knowledge of Spring Framework that prepares you for building modern web applications.",
